# SecureNotes

### This is a simple app that can secure notes with a password, and hide the notes till the day is here.

Insipiration: I created this app because I wanted to write a letter for my girlfriend before going to Japan, because couple things. Being an iOS developer, I got creative and decided to up the antee and create a letter per day. Then make it to an app. Then locking it with a password, pretty much having a lot of fun with this app. 

There is definitely a lot that I can do with this app than just read it from a JSON file. For example, instead of having it client side I can have it server side, have users add secured notes that is peer to peer so that if I add a note, and say my girlfriend can read it tomorrow with this password, then it will show up on my girlfriends side but she won't be able to open it till the day of, AND when the app sends you a notification with the password. 

Here is a video of how it works.
